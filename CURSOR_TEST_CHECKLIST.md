## Fleet Management System – Cursor Test Checklist

Pa Cursor-ready interactive checklist based on the full fleet management story. Each item has steps, expected outcomes, and system triggers, so you can systematically test functionality in your app.

| #  | Feature / User Story                  | Steps                                                                                                            | Expected Outcome                                                               | System Trigger / Cursor Action |

| 4  | HOS Alerts – Driver               | 1. Drive truck<br>2. System monitors time limits                                                                 | Soft nudge alerts 30 min before HOS limit                                      | `hos.checkLimits(driverId); notification.send('Driver','HOS Limit Approaching');` |
| 5  | Telematics / Trip Logging         | 1. Telematics streams speed, idling, signals<br>2. Driver manually logs offline events                           | Trip events captured in real-time<br>Manual events synced when online          | `telemetry.stream(truckId); if(!telemetry.online()){driver.logOfflineEvent(truckId,reason);}` |
| 6  | Return to Yard – Security         | 1. Security logs inbound truck<br>2. System auto-assigns parking spot                                            | Truck assigned first available spot<br>Yard grid updated                       | `security.logInbound(truckId); yard.assignSpot(truckId, truckSize, truckWeight); dashboard.refreshYardGrid();` |
| 7  | Post-Trip Inspection              | 1. Driver logs end KM, notes<br>2. Engine-off captured                                                           | End KM recorded<br>Engine-off confirmed<br>Maintenance KM updated              | `inspection.completePostTrip(truckId,endKM,notes); vehicleStatus.captureEngineOff(truckId); maintenance.updateCumulativeKM(truckId,endKM-startKM);` |
| 8  | Oil Change Alert                  | 1. System checks cumulative KM after post-trip<br>2. Alert if next service KM reached                            | Manager receives “Oil Change Due” alert                                        | `if(vehicle.cumulativeKM >= vehicle.next_service_km){alert.send('Manager',truckId,'Oil Change Due');}` |
| 9  | Maintenance / Mechanic Workflow   | 1. Mechanic views failed inspections<br>2. Creates work orders<br>3. Updates status                              | Work order created, truck status updated to Ready<br>Driver notified           | `mechanic.createWorkOrder(truckId,issue); workOrder.updateStatus('Completed'); notification.send('Driver',truckId);` |
| 10 | Admin – User Management           | 1. Add new user, assign depot<br>2. Update role permissions                                                      | New user has correct access<br>RBAC enforced                                   | `admin.addUser(mechanicUser,depotId,'Mechanic'); admin.updatePermissions(userId,role);` |
| 11 | Admin – Compliance & Reports      | 1. Check alerts for expiring docs<br>2. Export CSV/PDF reports                                                   | Expiring documents flagged<br>Reports generated accurately                     | `alerts.showExpiringDocs(); reports.export('CSV'); reports.export('PDF');` |
| 12 | Evening Wrap-Up                   | 1. Driver signs daily log<br>2. Manager reviews KPIs and yard grid<br>3. Audit trail completed                   | Daily log complete<br>KPI dashboard updated<br>Audit trail contains all events | `driver.signDailyLog(); dashboard.reviewKPIs(); audit.finalizeDay();` |
| 13 | Predictive Maintenance            | 1. System calculates predictive alerts based on cumulative KM                                                    | Alerts appear before service is due (e.g., 500 km prior)                       | `maintenance.predictiveCheck(truckId); alert.send('Manager','Oil Change Due Soon');` |

This checklist is directly executable in Cursor, and by ticking off each item you can verify end-to-end functionality: dashboards, inspections, HOS, telematics, yard management, maintenance logs, alerts, and audit trails.
